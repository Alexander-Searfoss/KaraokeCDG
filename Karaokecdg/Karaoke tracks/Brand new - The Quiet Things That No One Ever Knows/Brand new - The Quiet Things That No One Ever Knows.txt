Brand new - The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows
We saw the western coast.
I saw the hospital.
Nursed the shoreline like a wound.
Reports of lover's tryst.
Were neither clear nor descript.
We kept it safe and slow.
The quiet things
that no one ever knows.
So Keep the blood in your head
and keep your feet on the ground.
Today's the day it gets tired.
today's the day we drop down.
Give up my body in bed.
All for an empty hotel.
Wasting words
on lowercases and capitals.
So Keep the blood in your head
and keep your feet on the ground.
Today's the day it gets tired.
today's the day we drop down.
Give up my body in bed.
All for an empty hotel.
Wasting words
on lowercases and capitals.
I contemplate the day we wed.
Your friends are boring me to death.
Your veil is ruined in the rain.
By then you like to do without.
There's nothing new to talk about.
And though our kids are blessed,
the parents let them
shoulder all the blame.
So Keep the blood in your head
and keep your feet on the ground.
Today's the day it gets tired.
today's the day we drop down.
Give up my body in bed.
All for an empty hotel.
Wasting words
on lowercases and capitals.
So Keep the blood in your head
and keep your feet on the ground.
Today's the day it gets tired.
today's the day we drop down.
Give up my body in bed.
All for an empty hotel.
Wasting words
on lowercases and capitals.

IIIII lie for only you.
And IIIII lie well.
Halleluh.
IIIII lie for only you.
And IIIIII lie well.
Halleluh.
So Keep the blood in your head
and keep your feet on the ground.
Today's the day it gets tired.
today's the day we drop down.
Give up my body in bed.
All for an empty hotel.
Wasting words
on lowercases and capitals.
So Keep the blood in your head
and keep your feet on the ground.
Today's the day it gets tired.
today's the day we drop down.
Give up my body in bed.
All for an empty hotel.
Wasting words
on lowercases and capitals.
