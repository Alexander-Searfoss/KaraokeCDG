Lil Dicky - Save That Money
Trap God, and we servin' up the whole world

In the bank but you know I ain't tryna
blow that baby
Ay, we gon' save that money

Rap game got it all wrong
We ain't 'bout to go and spend money
just to flex on em
We ain't really got it like ya'll
I'm the type of motherfucker
that'll check the check
Do the math, I ain't never gettin' robbed
Those margaritas not goin' on my card
I ain't 'bout to split a damn thing
for convenience sake
I'm at the restaurant workin' that waitress
hold up You ain't heard of lil Dave
young L the Jew biz major
Fuck you know 'bout the world he raised in?
I've been saving money
since a motherfucker thirteen
I wear the same pair of jeans everyday
Free sandwiches homie two stamps away
Booked flight in December but I leave in May
Drugs are generic but still work the same
I get login's for Netflix from my cousin Greg

All of them bitches actin' thoughtless
I disregard them
All of them bitches actin' holy

I can teach a lil nigga somethin'
like a preacher
I can take his ass to church
fresh as hell, no Easter
I can make his ass burp like a baby
but i dont hiccup

Quan what does this
have to do with saving money though?
You know what the full verse

unless the meter green homie
Hair cut several months in between homie
Hit the motherfuckin'
lights when I leave homie
Single ply TP ass bleed
Air BnB the mother fucker

Happy hour takin' out the chicken

Coppin' sweaters in the summer

I ain't never hit a bar with a cover
Low thread count, hard with the covers
Free trial memberships though
I never join the shits though
the Fuck you think this is dawg
Frequent flying like a motherfuckin'
finch tho
General Tso, half a dozen on the stick
Just so I can whet the appetite of dick
What you talkin' about?
My AC never doing nothing, blow fans tho
Walgreens card shoppin' all da off brands tho
Boy go hard when collecting, got Venmo
Save every motherfuckin' roach, tryna smoke
Check the clothes in my drawers
I ain't playin' around
It's LD, lil boy, Mr. Hand me down
Dirty drawers gettin' worn

You think I got four fitty up in quarters on me

Everyone these niggas tryna play me
And lately I been stackin' up crazy
Stackin' up all about the Bands baby
eight hundred k underneath the bed baby
ay If you at a restaurant
and you got an iced coffee
And the waiter been refillin' that
without a word of caution
And you get your fuckin' bill
and you can see 'em double chargin'
For the coffee and you told 'em
there's a problem
Sing a long like
Ohh don't double charge for me for that
Don't double charge me, we like
Ohh don't double charge for me for that
Don't do it to yourself
'Cause I might just ask
what the ice cube's worth
What the ice cube's worth
That's the only differentiator
in making this a non free perk
And I might make work
more difficult for you than it need be
So think about it, take a minute
let it breathe b
But think about it bro,
you saw me get the burger
with the bacon on the side
After looking at the price
of the side of just bacon
and comparing it
To what the difference in a cheeseburger
verse the bacon cheeseburger was
in making my decision
I would hate to be the waiter
tryna tell me something different
Imma get on Yelp in a minute
and review this piece of shit place
like only a Kike know how
Unless you take the extra coffee off
I might get loud
Unless you, oh, it was just an accident?
You didn't even mean that?
you didnt even
oh
I'm so embarrassed
